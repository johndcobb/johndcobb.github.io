#### April 19-20, 2025
Organizers: [John Cobb](https://johndcobb.github.io), [Luke Oeding](http://webhome.auburn.edu/~lao0004/), [Michael Burr](https://cecas.clemson.edu/~burr2/), [Kisun Lee](https://klee669.github.io), and [Anton Leykin](https://antonleykin.math.gatech.edu).

## Overview
The Meeting on Applied Algebraic Geometry (MAAG) is a regional gathering which attracts participants primarily from the South-East of the United States. MAAG 2025 takes place at Auburn University on April 19-20, 2025. Previous meetings took place at Georgia Tech in [2015](https://sites.google.com/site/magaspring15/), [2018](https://sites.google.com/view/maag-2018/home), [2019](https://sites.google.com/view/maag2019/home), and [2023](https://sites.google.com/view/maag-2023/home) and at Clemson in [2016](https://www.math.clemson.edu/aca/maga16/). 

For funding, please apply by March 12th.

## Talks
There are eight 50-minute talks by:
- [Thomas Kahle](https://thomas-kahle.de) (OvGU Magdeburg)

        <summary> Title: The likelihood correspondence </summary>
        Abstract: We study SNC arrangements of hypersurfaces and the critical locus of Laurent monomials in the equations of the smooth hypersurfaces.  This locus is an irreducible variety in the product of two projective spaces, known in algebraic statistics as the likelihood correspondence and in particle physics as the scattering correspondence.  We establish an explicit determinantal representation for the bihomogeneous prime ideal of this variety. SNC arrangements are characterized by the non-vanishing of the Euler discriminant. This is joint work with Hal Schenck, Bernd Sturmfels, and Maximilian Wiesmann.

        <summary> Title: Gaussian Voronoi Cells </summary>
        Abstract: Gaussian discriminant analysis is a supervised learning algorithm for classification. Fundamental to understanding the performance of this algorithm is to understand the set of points closest to a given Gaussian, where "closest" is defined in terms of the maximum likelihood function. This set of points is the Gaussian Voronoi cell of the Gaussian. In this talk, I will outline new results regarding the geometry and combinatorics of Gaussian Voronoi cells and I will discuss implications for the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, a popular method of density estimation for Gaussian mixture models. This is joint work with Joe Kileel.

        <summary> Title: Faithful tropicalization of curves  </summary>
        Abstract: Tropicalization of an algebraic curve has both an abstract version (as a dual graph) and an embedded version (as a polyhedral complex). A bridge that links the two is provided by faithful tropicalization, which depends on a suitable embedding. I will discuss work in progress on effective methods for finding embeddings for faithful tropicalizations. As a consequence, this gives computational methods for computing dual graphs.

        <summary> Title: Equi-affine minimal-degree moving frames for polynomial curves </summary>
        Abstract: Classical equivariant moving frames play an important role in differential geometry and invariant theory. However, these frames associated with a polynomial curve are, in general, neither polynomial nor even rational. We develop a theory and an algorithm for constructing minimal-degree polynomial moving frames for polynomial curves in an affine space. The algorithm is equivariant under volume-preserving affine transformations of the ambient space and the parameter shifts. We show that any matrix-completion algorithm can be turned into an equivariant moving frame algorithm via an equivariantization procedure that we develop. We prove that if a matrix-completion algorithm is of minimal degree, so is the resulting equivariant moving frame algorithm. We propose a novel minimal-degree matrix-completion algorithm, complementing the existing body of literature on this topic. This is a joint work with Hoon Hong, North Carolina State University.

## Policies

We are required by the NSF Proposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide (Chapter II.E.7), effective February 25, 2019, to provide all event participants with information on the University’s policy on sexual and other forms of harassment or sexual assault as well as directions on how to report any violations of this policy. For purposes of this requirement, “other forms of harassment” is defined as “non-gender or non-sex-based harassment of individuals protected under federal civil rights laws, as set forth in organizational policies or codes of conduct, statutes, regulations, or executive orders.”

Auburn University is committed to creating and maintaining a community dedicated to the advancement, application and transmission of knowledge and creative endeavors through academic excellence, where all individuals who participate in University programs and activities can work and learn together in an atmosphere free of harassment, exploitation, or intimidation.

The University has general policies prohibiting harassment and discrimination on the basis of protected categories, including the Auburn University Policies Related to the Workplace; AA/EEO Policies and Procedures; and Code of Student Conduct.

Any person may report incidents of sexual violence, sexual harassment, relationship violence, stalking, or other forms of prohibited behavior to the campus Title IX office. [aub.ie/TitleIX](aub.ie/TitleIX) has links to report an incident and additional information is available on this site.
