#### **Office Hours:**  10:00-11:00 Thursdays and Fridays in Extension Hall, Office 204A (Upstairs)

## Essential Information

The central location for all course-related information (schedule, homework, syllabus, etc) is [Canvas](). All solutions to quizzes, tests, and worksheets will be posted to Canvas. There will be three in-semester exams, which will be held on September 18th, October 16th, and November 13th. The final exam will be on Friday, December 12th from 10:30-12:30. There will be 3 quizzes during recitation, one on September 4th, October 2nd, and October 28th. 

When you have a question, of course feel free to [email me](mailto:{{ site.email }}) but also please consider posting it to [Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/mc2dwdow4q62sa) (which you can do anonymously!) so that everyone can benefit from the discussion. It is incredibly likely that someone else is struggling with a similar issue. 

We will be covering Chapters 12-16 of James Stewart's *Calculus: Early Transcendentals*, 8th edition. If you'd like to offer anonymous feedback to me, click the button below.

## Class Policies

### Exercises, Assessment, and Grading

#### Worksheets
Each section covered in class will have its own worksheet. Of the problems on this worksheet, a handful will be selected to be graded and will be turned in via gradescope. Most selected problems will be graded for completeness, although I may choose one or two to grade in full and provide comments. The problems that will be graded will be printed at the top of the worksheet. The remaining ungraded problems are there to provide further practice and form a study guide for the test. After submission, full solutions will be posted. 

Due dates for worksheets will be roughly one week after we finish that section and will be visible on gradescope. there will be a 24 hour grace period after the due date -- this is to allow for any last minute submission issues. After the grace period, no late submissions will be allowed. The three lowest worksheet scores will be dropped. 

#### Quizzes
There will be three in-class quizzes and their dates are listed above. No make-up quizzes will be given; however, the lowest quiz score will be dropped.

#### Exams
There will be three in-class exams and their dates are listed above. These exams will be focused on material covered since the last exam, but will rely on ideas and methods learned earlier in the semester. A test can only be made-up if there is a [university approved excuse](https://bulletin.auburn.edu/Policies/Academic/classattendance/). Exam must be made up within one week of the test. It is the studentâ€™s responsibility to make arrangements for any work and/or notes missed due to an absence. 

There will also be a final exam covering all material. 

#### Grading Scheme
Your course grade will be based on three in-class exams (20% each), the average of three quizzes and your worksheet scores (15% total), and a comprehensive final exam (25%). **However**, if your final exam score is better than your lowest test score then the exam will have weight 35%, and the low test score 5%. The lowest quiz score will be dropped and the lowest three worksheet scores will be dropped.

Grade cutoffs will be never stricter than 90% for an A- grade, 80% for a B-, 70% for a C-, and 60% for a D-. Some exams may have grade cutoffs set more generously depending on their difficulty.

### Academic Honesty
All portions of the [Auburn University student academic honesty code](https://sites.auburn.edu/admin/universitypolicies/Policies/AcademicHonestyCode.pdf) will apply to this class. All academic honesty violations or alleged violations of the SGA Code of Laws will be reported to the Office of the Provost, which will then refer the case to the Academic Honesty Committee. Tiger Cards will be checked for all exams.

### Disabilities
Students who need accommodations are asked to electronically submit their approved accommodations through AU Access and to arrange a meeting with their TA during office hours the first week of classes, or as soon as possible if accommodations are needed immediately. If you have not established accommodations through the Office of Accessibility, but need accommodations, make an appointment with the Office of Accessibility, 1228 Haley Center, 844-2096.

## Resources

It is okay if you get confused. Luckily for us, there are many great resources for the modern calculus student. 

- Your fellow classmates should be your primary resource. Post to [Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/mc2dwdow4q62sa) as yourself or anonymously to discuss material with the people that are learning it at the same time as you.
- [Paul's Online Notes](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcIII/CalcIII.aspx) are very clear and have worked out examples and practice problems. His notes are good at getting to the *practical* things you need to know to solve problems.
- [Professor Leonard](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoHhuummRZaIVX7bD4t2czg) basically taught me all of Calculus 3 as an undergraduate. He also inspires me to work out. Seriously, check him out.
- [WolframAlpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/) can compute answers to essentially any calculus query that you enter, although the free version will not provide worked out solutions. Fortunately, Auburn provides [a license to Mathematica](https://auburn.service-now.com/it?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=d625f5ca1ba7781069bb3227dc4bcb51) which contains WolframAlpha.
